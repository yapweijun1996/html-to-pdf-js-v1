# GeckoPDF.js

A browser-based HTML to PDF renderer inspired by Firefox's print engine.

This project aims to provide high-fidelity, paginated PDF output using only front-end technologies.

## Usage

See the `demo` folder for a basic example. Build and run the demo in a modern browser.

## Development

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Currently only basic DOM cloning and PDF export are implemented.
