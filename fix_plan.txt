/* Fix Plan for PDF Exporter Rendering Issues */

1. Issue: List Bullet Rendering
   - Problem: List markers (bullets or numbers) are not rendered correctly in the PDF output.
   - Proposed Fix:
     • Review how list elements are extracted and rendered.
     • Ensure CSS for list markers is correctly applied or reinsert the markers during PDF generation.
     • Validate by comparing the browser render and the generated PDF.

2. Issue: Font Inconsistencies
   - Problem: Fonts in the generated PDF do not match the original HTML (e.g., header fonts versus bold fonts).
   - Proposed Fix:
     • Revise the font mapping and initialization logic to more accurately distinguish header, bold, and regular fonts.
     • Remove any redundant assignments and enforce strict matching with expected CSS rules.
     • Validate by checking text rendering in test documents.

3. Issue: Image Scaling and Rendering
   - Problem: Images might be improperly scaled or rendered in the PDF.
   - Proposed Fix:
     • Review the image processing pipeline (e.g., canvas conversion and data URL creation).
     • Adjust scaling logic to preserve image quality and aspect ratio.
     • Confirm by testing with various images, ensuring dimensions and clarity match the source.

Additional Issues:

4. Layout and Spacing Anomalies
   - Problem: Margins, padding, and element positioning may differ between the HTML and the PDF.
   - Proposed Fix:
     • Enhance the extraction of computed styles to maintain layout fidelity.
     • Possibly add custom adjustments for common discrepancies (e.g., list indentation, paragraph spacing).

5. Color and Style Mismatches
   - Problem: CSS styles, especially color definitions, may not transfer correctly to the PDF.
   - Proposed Fix:
     • Improve the CSS parsing logic to fully support all standard color formats and inline styles.
     • Test with documents featuring complex background and text color scenarios.

Overall Testing Strategy:
   • Use a comprehensive test HTML page that includes various elements (lists, headers, images, paragraphs, etc.).
   • Iteratively test the PDF output, comparing it visually to the browser-rendered version.
   • Refine extraction and rendering logic based on observed variances until the output meets the desired fidelity.
